# Silly Race (Clone) Project
There are still some deficiencies in the mechanics in the clone project I have done. It is under development.

Various third party plugins were used while developing the project. Some of those: <br />
-DOTween <br />
-Cinemachine <br />
-SkyBox Assets <br />

Chasing, moving, avoiding obstacles mechanics of opponent characters are created with NavMesh.
